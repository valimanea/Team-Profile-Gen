  ## Description  

  This is a Node.js command-line application for creating a team profile webpage. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also there are tests provided to make sure that the application is built correctly when every part of your code passes each provided test. The code is written in index.js and uses Inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes.
  
  The application accepts one manager and multiple engineers and interns. When a user decides to finish building their team, they exit the application and the HTML is generated.
